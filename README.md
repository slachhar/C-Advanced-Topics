DELEGATES
They are just like a class but not a class. They are reference types. 
1. We create them.
2. We declare them by creating a reference type and then initialize them by assigning to a method of similar signature.
3. Then we invoke them which as a result will invoke all the assigned methods to a delegate.
4. They are used for extension of the class methods without disturbing the existing class and also used for creating events.
5. For extension, we invoke then in a class but assign methods which are also called subscribes, outside the class.
